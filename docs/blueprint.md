- Accent color: Bright Yellow (#FFD700) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.

- Design a side bar which slides in from the side with round corners and a semi-transparent background. No full page covering side bar should be included. Website title bar with color should be on right side.
- Implement smooth transitions and animations for the chicken character and the multiplier gates, create a sense of depth, motion, and reward as the chicken moves through the multiplier gates.
